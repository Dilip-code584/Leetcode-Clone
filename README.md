Here's a simplified outline of the steps involved in building a basic version of this platform:

Frontend Development:

You can use modern web development technologies like React, Redux, and a code editor library to create the frontend of your platform.

User Authentication:

Create a user registration and login system.
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
Implement password hashing for security.
Question List Page:

Create a page that displays a list of preset problems.
Each problem should have a title, description, and a button to start solving it.
Implement user authentication to restrict access to authenticated users only.
Code Editor:

Use a code editor library like CodeMirror or Ace Editor to provide a code editing interface.
Allow users to write code in multiple programming languages.
Backend Development:

You'll need a backend server to handle user requests, manage user data, and execute user-submitted code. You can use Node.js and Express.js for the backend.

User Data Storage:

Use a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store user data, including account information and progress on problems.
Authentication:

Implement user registration and login endpoints.
Use libraries like Passport.js for authentication.
API Endpoints:

Create API endpoints for managing questions, user progress, and code execution.
Include endpoints for retrieving problem details and submitting code.
Code Execution Engine:

You can use external code execution APIs like Repl.it, Judge0, or HackerRank API to execute user-submitted code.
Implement a middleware to send user code to the execution engine and compare the results.
Integration with Code Execution API:

Set up an integration with a code execution service like Repl.it or Judge0 to compile and run user code.
You'll need to send the code to their API, capture the output, and compare it to the expected output to assess correctness.
Testing and Security:

Implement proper validation and security measures to prevent code injection and other vulnerabilities.
Write unit and integration tests for your backend and frontend components.
Deployment:

Deploy your frontend and backend on cloud services like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel.
Secure your deployment with HTTPS.
Documentation and User Interface:

Create user documentation to explain how to use the platform.
Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Monitoring and Scaling:

Implement monitoring and error tracking to identify and resolve issues promptly.
Plan for scalability as your user base grows.
Continuous Development:

Regularly update the platform with new questions and features.
Consider implementing a rating system for problems and solutions.
